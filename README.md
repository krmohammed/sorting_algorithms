# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project contains C implementations of the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort

## Implementation Details

### 1. Bubble Sort

- File: `0-bubble_sort.c`
- Description: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Insertion Sort

- File: `1-insertion_sort.c`
- Description: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### 3. Selection Sort

- File: `2-selection_sort.c`
- Description: Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.

### 4. Quick Sort

- File: `3-quick_sort.c`
- Description: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

Ensure that you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your machine.
